# Cloud storage tests
This repo contains few tests for different storage systems in Azure.

**Note: this is not professional test nor official guidance and information are getting old very quickly. Main purpose of this repo is to learn major aspects and decision factors to support architecture decisions - not to provide precise benchmarks (create specific ones for your use case if you need to).**
